## 🚀 Project Overview

**Customer Churn AI** currently allows users to:

- Input basic customer information (tenure, charges, contract type, internet service, payment method)  
- Predict the risk of churn (Low, Medium, High)  
- Visualize churn probability with a progress bar  

This is **just the beginning**. The platform will evolve into a **full-fledged dashboard** for businesses with:

- Multi-domain support (telecom, food delivery, membership services, retail buyers, etc.)  
- Personalized suggestions for retaining each customer  
- Advanced ML models trained on additional features (e.g., age, gender, purchase history)  
- Enhanced analytics and visualization tools
